I didn't upload the jar file, you can compile it using Eclipse

There aren't any Maven or ANT or Gradle compilation methods, and I don't
think there ever will be.

## Some Unnecessary Comments

It uses a custom renderer which draws everything into a pixel array buffer

I used this project as a learning method to better understand 2D Graphics by
writing my own very simple (and bad) renderer.

Drawing circles and lines and rectangles are all done badly, could be improved a great deal.
